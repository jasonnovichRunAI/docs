# Integrate Run:ai with Ray

Ray is an open-source unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications like machine learning. It provides the compute layer for parallel processing so that you donâ€™t need to be a distributed systems expert.

## Install Ray operator

You must install KubeRay version 0.5.0 or greater in order to work with the different types of Ray workloads.

Use the following commands:

```bash
helm repo add kuberay https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay-helm/

helm install kuberay-operator kuberay/kuberay-operator -n kuberay-operator --version 0.5.0 --create-namespace
```

For more information, see [Deploying RayKube operator](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/getting-started.html#deploying-the-kuberay-operator){target=_blank}.

## Submit a Ray job

Run:AI integrates with ray by interacting with the kuberay CRDs (RayJob, RayServe and RayCluster). The following is an example of RayJob scheduled by Run:AI.
Use the following command to submit your Ray job:

`kubectl apply -f <path/example-file-name.yaml>`

For more information, see [Run an example job](https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay/guidance/rayjob/#run-an-example-job){target=_blank}.

```yml

## Ray autoscaling cluster

For more information, see [Ray autoscaling](https://docs.run.ai/v2.12/admin/workloads/policies/#creating-a-policy){target=_blank}.

Use the following command to submit your Ray autoscaling cluster:

`kubectl apply -f <path/example-file-name.yaml>`

Example:

```yml
# This config demonstrates KubeRay's Ray autoscaler integration.
# The resource requests and limits in this config are too small for production!
# For an example with more realistic resource configuration, see
# ray-cluster.autoscaler.large.yaml.
