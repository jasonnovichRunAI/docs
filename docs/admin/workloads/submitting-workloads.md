## How to Submit a Workload

To submit a workload using the UI:

1. In the left menu press *Workloads*.
2. Press *New Workload*, and select *Workspace*, *Training*, or *Inference*.

=== "Workspace"

      1. In the *Projects* pane, select a project. Use the search box to find projects that are not listed. If you can't find the project, see your system administrator.
      2. In the *Templates* pane, select a template from the list. Use the search box to find templates that are not listed. If you can't find the specific template you need, create a new one, or see your system administrator.
      3. Enter a `Workspace` name, and press continue.
      4. In the *Environment* pane select or [create a new environment](../../Researcher/user-interface/workspaces/create/create-env.md). Use the search box to find environments that are not listed.
      5. In the *Compute resource* pane, select resources for your trainings or [create a new compute resource](../../Researcher/user-interface/workspaces/create/create-compute.md). Use the search box to find resources that are not listed. Press *More settings* to use **Node Affinity** to limit the resources to a specific node.
      6. Open the *Volume* pane, and press *Volume* to add a volume to your training.

         1. Select the *Storage class* from the dropdown.
         2. Select the *Access mode* from the dropdown.
         3. Enter a claim size, and select the units.
         4. Select a *Volume system*, mode from the dropdown.
         5. Enter the *Container path* for volume target location.
         6. Select a *Volume persistency.

      7. In the *Data sources* pane, press *add a new data source*. For more information, see [Creating a new data source](../../Researcher/user-interface/workspaces/create/create-ds.md) When complete press, *Create Data Source*.
      
        !!! Note
            Data sources that have private credentials that have the status of issues found will be greyed out.

      8. In the *General* pane, add special settings for your training (optional):

         1. Press *Auto-deletion* to delete the training automatically when it either completes or fails. You can configure the timeframe in days, hours, minuets, and seconds. If the timeframe is set to 0, the training will be deleted immediately after it completes or fails.
         2. Press *Annotation* to a name and value to annotate the training. Repeat this step to add multiple annotations.
         3. Press *Label* to a name and value to label the training. Repeat this step to add multiple labels.
