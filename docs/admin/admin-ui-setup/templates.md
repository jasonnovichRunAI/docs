A template is a pre-set configuration that is used to quickly configure and submit workloads using existing assets.
A template consists of all the assets a workload needs, allowing researchers to submit a workload in a single click, or make subtle adjustments to differentiate them from each other.

## Creating Templates

To create a template:

1. In the left menu, press *Templates*, then press *New Template*.
2. In the *Scope* pane, select a cluster, department, or project.
3. In the *Template Name* pane, enter a name for the template.
4. Select an environment from the tiles. If your environment is not listed, use the *Search environments* box to find it or press [*New environment*](../../Researcher/user-interface/workspaces/create/create-env.md) to create a new environment. Press  to create an environment if needed. In the *Set the connection for your tool(s)*, enter the URL of the tool if a custom URL has been enabled in the selected environment. Use the *Private* toggle to lock access to the tool to only the creator of the environment.

       In the *Runtime Settings*:
    
       1. Press *Commands and Arguments* to add special commands and arguments to your environment selection.
       2. Press *Environment variable* to add an environment variable. Press again if you need more environment variables.

5. In the *Compute resource* pane, select a compute resource. Use the *Search compute resources* if you do not see your resource listed. Press *New compute resource* to add a new compute resource to the system. Press *More settings* to add a node type (node affinity) to the compute resource selected.
6. (Optional) In the *Volume* pane, press *+volume* to add a new volume to the template.

    From the drop down menus select:
    * Storage class
    * Access mode
    * Claim size and units
    * Volume mode

    Set the *Volume target location*, then select from either a *Persistent* volume or an *Ephemeral* volume.

7. In the *Data sources* pane, select a data source. Press *New data source* to add a new data source to the system.
8. In the *General* pane, choose to add the following:

    * Auto-deletion&mdash;the time after which a workload that has completed or failed will be deleted. Press *+Auto-deletion* then configure the time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
    * Annotation&mdash;press *+ Annotation* then enter a name and a value. You can add multiple annotations by pressing the *+ Annotation*.
    * Label&mdash;press *+Label* then enter a name and a value. You can add multiple labels by pressing the *+Label*.

9. Press *Create template* when your configuration is complete.

## Download Templates Table

You can download the templates table to a CSV file. Downloading a CSV can provide a snapshot history of your templates over the course of time, and help with compliance tracking. All the columns that are selected (displayed) in the table will be downloaded to the file.

Use the *Cluster* filter at the top of the table to see templates that are assigned to specific clusters.

!!! Note
    The cluster filter will be in the top bar when there are clusters that are installed with version 2.16 or lower.

Use the *Add filter* to add additional filters to the table.

To download the templates table to a CSV:

1. Open *Templates*.
2. From the *Columns* icon, select the columns you would like to have displayed in the table.
3. Click on the ellipsis labeled *More*, and download the CSV.
