##### Role based access control

Stating in this version, Run:ai had updated the authorization system to Role Based Access Control (RBAC). RBAC is a policy-neutral access control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. For more information, see [Role based access control](../admin/runai-setup/access-control/rbac.md#role-based-access-control).

When upgrading the system, previous access and authorizations that were configured will be migrated to the new RBAC roles. See the table below for role conversions:

| Previous user type | RBAC role |
| -- | -- |
| Admin | [System admin](../admin/runai-setup/access-control/rbac.md#roles) |
| next one | [next one](../admin/runai-setup/access-control/rbac.md#roles) |
