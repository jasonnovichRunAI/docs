# API Authentication

The following document explains how to authenticate with Run:ai APIs.

Run:ai APIs are accessed using *bearer tokens*. A token can be obtained in several ways:

* When logging into the Run:ai user interface, you enter an email and password (or authenticated via single sign-on) which are used to obtain a token.
* When using the Run:ai command-line, you use a Kubernetes profile and are authenticated by pre-running `runai login` (or oc login with OpenShift). The command attaches a token to the profile and allows you access to Run:ai functionality.
* When using Run:ai APIs, you need to create an **Application** through the Run:ai user interface. The Application is created with specific roles and contains a *secret*. Using the secret you can obtain a token and use it within subsequent API calls.

## Create a Client Application

* Open the Run:ai Run:ai User Interface.
* Go to `Settings & Tools`, `Application` and create a new Application.
* Copy the `<APPLICATION>` and `<SECRET KEY>` to be used below


### Access rules for the Application

In order for you API requests to be accepted, you will need to set access rules for the application.
To assign roles to an application, see [Create or Delete rules](../admin/runai-setup/access-control/rbac.md#create-or-delete-rules).

Use the [Roles](../admin/runai-setup/access-control/rbac.md#roles) table to assign the correct roles to the application.

## Request an API Token

Use the above parameters to get a temporary token to access Run:ai as follows.

### Example command to get an API token

Replace `<COMPANY-URL>` below with:

  * For SaaS installations use `<company>.run.ai`

  * For self-hosted use the Run:ai user interface URL.

=== "cURL"
    ``` bash
        curl  -X POST \
          'https://<runai_url>/api/v1/token' \
          --header 'Accept: */*' \
          --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          --data-raw '{
          "grantType":"app_token",
          "AppId":"<APPLICATION NAME>",
          "AppSecret" : "<SECRET KEY>"
        }'
    ```

=== "Python"
    ``` python
        import requests
        import json
        reqUrl = "https://cp-590d-run-13764-kc-upgrade.runailabs.com/api/v1/token"
        headersList = {
         "Accept": "*/*",
         "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
        payload = json.dumps({
          "grantType":"app_token",
          "AppId":"<APPLICATION NAME>",
          "AppSecret" : "<SECRET KEY>"
        })
        response = requests.request("POST", reqUrl, data=payload,  headers=headersList)
        print(response.text)
    ```

### Response

The API response will look as follows:

``` JSON title="API Response"
{
  "accessToken": "<TOKEN>", 
}
```

To call APIs, the application must pass the retrieved `accessToken` as a *Bearer token* in the Authorization header of your HTTP request.

* To retrieve and manipulate Workloads, use the [Cluster API](cluster-api/workload-overview-dev.md). Researcher API works at the cluster level and you will have different endpoints for different clusters.
* To retrieve and manipulate other metadata objects, use the [Administrator REST API](admin-rest-api/overview.md). Administrator API works at the control-plane level and you have a single endpoint for all clusters.
